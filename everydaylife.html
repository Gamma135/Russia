                                For breakfast Russian people usually have milk porridge, syrniki (cottage cheese pancakes) or an omelette. Lunch is more sufficient and it often consists of a salad, a plate of soup and a main course. For dinner the Russians love fish and meat dishes with garnish (rice, buckwheat, mashed potatoes and stewed cabbage). Traditional pelmeni (meat dumplings), holodetz (meat jelly with pieces of meat, carrot and garlic) or golubtsy (cabbage rolls with minced meat) are special masterpieces of the national culinary art. The Russians also have salads, meat pies, apple pies, vareniki (cottage cheese, cherries or potatoes dumplings) and pancakes for dinner.

                             <p>
                                The most traditional Russian salads are Olivier, “Herring under a furcoat” and vinegret. All of them are a nourishing mixture of various ingredients such as boiled eggs, boiled vegetables (potatoes, carrots, beetroot), sausage or meat, onions, green peas and cucumbers.

                                Russian cuisine is famous for the variety of soups: shchi (cabbage soup), borsch (red beetroot soup), ukha (fish soup), solyanka (thick soup made of pickled veggies, meat and sausage) and rassolnik (pickle soup). A plate of hot and spicy soup helps to stay warm during long cold winters. And one of the favourite soups during hot summers is okroshka (cold vegetable and sausage soup based on kvas). All kinds of soups are normally dressed with sour-cream. It is notable that Russian people eat bread with all dishes.

                                Traditional Russian drinks are hot black tea with jam or honey, compote (stewed fruit drink) and kvas (drink made from rye bread).

                                The Russians are good at preserving fruits, vegetables and mushrooms. Classic Russian appetizers: pickled cabbage, tomatoes, crispy cucumbers and even apples – are always on a festive table.

                    <h2 class="topic-title">Houses and flats</h2>        

                            <p>
                                A common one-bedroom flat (bedroom + living room) is called a two-room flat in Russia. However, the Russian house often has a separate kitchen. Besides, a separate kitchen should also have a door in accordance with the Russian civil design standards.
                                In order to get inside the Russian house you need to get through a metal door that can withstand a small storm operation. A ground floor in blocks of flats is often inhabited, and its windows are protected with bars. Metal doors became popular in a spate of criminal activities in the 1990s. However, Russians still need to protect their homes due to an economic disparity. Metal doors with coded locks or entry phones protect the entrance to multi-storey blocks of flats.
                                A TV set is one the main sources of entertainment in Russia. It broadcasts amusing programs, forms public opinion and gives medical advice (often bad).
                                A bigger part of Russia has clayed soil. When it is raining or snowing, streets get covered with mud and dust. In this case, neither asphalt nor cobblestone will be of any help.
                                The only way to keep your house clean is to take off shoes when you step over the doorstep. Besides, winter shoes are trimmed with fur, so it would be unsanitary to wear these shoes inside! When you enter the Russian house you take off heavy boots and put on slippers to “let your feet breathe”.

                    <h2 class="topic-title">Dacha</h2>        

                            <p>
                                Dacha is a Russian country house with a small garden where city dwellers have their leisure time and do gardening. It's not just a "house in the village"! It’s much closer to the family estate in miniature.
                                Dacha is a special cultural and economic phenomenon in Russia. It has strong vibes of Russian mentality and culture, just like the Russian ballet, the intelligentsia or, even the “mysterious Russian soul”. Understanding the dacha may shed a light on the everyday life of people here, their thoughts, and aspirations.
                                Garden plots became essential source of food for many families. Do you know that still about 50% of potatoes in Russia were grown in the small private garden plots? At the Soviet times, adults and children spend all weekends on dachas to grow vegetables and make reserves for the winter time.
